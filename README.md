# Flow Task

> **Note:** This is a **frontend-only** project built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It does not include a backend/API server. All data and authentication features are either mocked or expected to be connected to an external API.

A modern, high-performance task and project management application built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Designed for teams and individuals who need a streamlined workflow management solution with enterprise-grade performance optimizations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Performance Architecture

Flow Task implements several performance optimization strategies:

#### Task Scheduler (`src/utils/performance.ts`)
- **Main Thread Management**: Yields control to prevent UI blocking
- **Chunked Processing**: Breaks large operations into manageable pieces
- **Debounced Operations**: Reduces unnecessary API calls and computations

#### Virtualization System
- **Automatic Threshold**: Activates for 20+ tasks or 15+ projects
- **Dynamic Height**: Adapts to grid/list view modes
- **Memory Efficient**: Only renders visible items

#### React Optimizations
- **Strategic Memoization**: Prevents unnecessary re-renders
- **Concurrent Features**: Uses React 18's startTransition for smooth UX
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loads components and routes

### State Management
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated business logic with `useTasks`, `useProjects`, `useAuth`
- **Local State**: Context-free state management for better performance
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with background sync

### Component Library
Built on **shadcn/ui** components for:
- Consistent design system
- Accessibility compliance
- Type-safe component props
- Customizable theming

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=your-api-endpoint
VITE_APP_NAME=Flow Task
VITE_ENABLE_MOCK_API=true
```

### Customization

#### Theme Configuration
Modify `tailwind.config.ts` for custom themes:

```typescript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // Your custom colors
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Performance Tuning
Adjust virtualization thresholds in `src/components/VirtualizedLists.tsx`:

```typescript
const shouldVirtualize = tasks.length > 20; // Adjust threshold
```
